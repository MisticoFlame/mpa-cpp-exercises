# MPA – C++ Exercises

A collection of programming exercises from MPA, focused on core CS concepts.

## Topics
- Arrays and linear search
- Sorting (Insertion Sort) + benchmarking
- Recursion (decimal to binary + trace)
- Recursion vs iteration (explicit stack)
- Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack)
- Backtracking (0/1 Knapsack brute force)



## Concepts Covered

- Dynamic memory management
- Recursion and stack simulation
- Sorting algorithms
- Time complexity analysis
- Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack)
- Backtracking

## Compilation
## Build & Run
Examples:

```bash
g++ 01-arrays/count_occurrences.cpp -o count && ./count
g++ 02-sorting/insertion_sort_benchmark.cpp -o bench && ./bench
g++ count_occurrences.cpp -o count
./count
